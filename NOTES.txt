- Cobblemon Images DB - 
Creating a dedicated database table to link images to Cobblemon entries would be a good way 
to keep everything organized. You could have columns like:

    dex_number: to link to the Pok√©mon's dex entry
    image_path: to store the path or URL to the image
    form_name (optional): if you have different images for forms (like Mega forms, etc.)

- Cobblemon Color Palette
Creating a database table to hold a three hexcode color palette for each Cobblemon.

    dex_number: Pokemon's dex entry
    pokemon_name: Pokemon's name
    colorpalette: hexcode color palette, csv format
